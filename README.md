**Description**

This project is made in Angular 6. As I  discussed with the concerned person, I did NOT create a backend for this project. If you want, I can easily create the backend for it in Node.js to make it a complete Full Stack application.

**How to Run**
(Assuming you have **npm** installed)

1) Clone this repo.

2) run the command `npm install` in the root folder of the project.

3) then run `npm start`

4) go to  URL http://localhost:4200
